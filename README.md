Github Repository for the Wyrmroost Minecraft Mod.

## Found a bug / issue?
Thats great but not really! You can report it [here](https://github.com/WolfShotz/Wyrmroost/issues)

## Licensing
You have probably noticed, atleast by now because your clearly reading this far into things, that the project is All Rights Reserved.
That is indeed the case, All Rights Reserved, as for code and assets are concerned. However, there are a few exceptions and conditions (As per "All Rights Reserved").

### Notice
By Contributing to this project (whether it be code, assets, language entries etc.) you are hereby granting us rights to what you contribute.
If there is a problem with that, either get in contact with me (WolfShotz) or just dont contribute.

With that said, you are hereby accepting to the following:

**You CAN**
 * Modify for private use
 * View and reference the code
 * Copy portions of the code* for use in your own projects**
 * Fork and Modify the code*
 * Submit Pull requests
 * Use this project for commercial use (Monetized media content etc.)
 
**You CANNOT**
 * Redstribute this project in its entirity, sourced or compiled.
 * Distribute code that contains 50%+ of this sources code without credit of me***
 * Distribute the project in a different form, or platform. Such as other mod loaders, or games.
 * Claim ownership of partial or total amounts of the original or re-packaged work.

**You MUST**
 * Keep a visible and clear repository of the code of which that is derived/inspried from this repository. Of course, you still maintain rights of your code, however you still need to keep a visible source.

*Code is CODE. NOT ASSETS. You cannot distribute any asset material under any modification or format (this includes remixes, transformations and other modifications of said material) unless explicitly stated.

**"Portions" can be considered 90% of the outcome of a particular result or function. Should anything surpass that amount, you must provide credit to me.

***Changing Variable names, adding whitespace, etc. is not different code! Basically, if it achieves the same result, its considered [Functionally Equivalent Statements (Alternate Behavior)](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-1698-3_1038) and falls under this category!

####TL;DR
This is a visible source project. You are free to look and reference the code all you want. Learn from it!
If you think you have improvements, tell me! Submit Pull Requests! I'm all ears!
Just please, don't be that guy who goes and steals peoples hard work. Seriously, its not that hard.
Also, redistribution makes it harder for everyone. For the players, and the developers, going around chicken chases for issues that may have already been addressed.
